        <span>Community service</span> is at the heart of the RVRC experience. The carefully crafted community 
        engagement activities are designed to make learning fun, while simultaneously becoming the catalyst for 
        strategic learning outcomes beyond the classroom.<br><br>
        
        The RVRC's annual <span>International Coastal Cleanup, Singapore (ICCS)</span>, organised in conjunction with the 
        <a href="https://oceanconservancy.org/trash-free-seas/international-coastal-cleanup/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
          Ocean Concervancy's International Coastal Cleanup
        </a> allows you to witness firsthand the challenges and impact of our marine debris, and the opportunity
        to make a direct difference to the cause.<br><br>

        RVRC organises an annual staff- and student-community college walk across the Southern Ridges, starting from
        the RVRC Lawn to the Mount Faber, spanning over 8 kilometres. This effort is a collaboration with NTUC FairPrice
        <span>Walk for Rice</span>, where for every 200 metres walked by one participant, NTUC donates 2 bowls of rice 
        to the underprivileged families. The college has contributed over 18,000 bowls of rice every year.<br><br>

        Apart from ICCS and Walk for Rice, the RVRC community volunteers one full day dedicated to helping underprivileged
        households. These activities range from cleaning and repainting of homes to food preparation and delivery at
        volunteer kitchens. These activities gives you the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries, to understand
        and reflect on their challenges and hardships, and emerge as a stronger individual and community.

        Apart from college-planned activities, student-led activities form an integral part in RVRC's mission to instil and 
        cultivate your holistic development in inclusivity, cultural sensitivity, and social awareness. These activities 
        allow like-minded students to share and build common interests, accommodated by the College's support through the 
        formation of <span>Interest Groups (IGs)</span>.<br><br>

        <span>Sports</span> form a major part of the IGs' diversity, such as chess, table tennis, badminton, floorball, 
        football, basketball, captain's ball, tchoukball, dodgeball, frisbee, touch rugby, tennis, volleyball, squash, yoga,
        board games, and even <span>e-sports</span>, such as Overwatch, FIFA, and Dota. You will also get the opportunity
        to bring your interest to a competitive level by participating in the annual <span>Inter-College Games</span>,
        <span>Inter-House Games</span>, or even <span>Inter-Faculty Games</span>.<br><br>

        Apart from sports, themed IGs such as <span>Jukebox</span> (music performance), <span>Dance ReVo</span> (dance performance), 
        <span>Artelier</span> (arts and crafts), <span>FoRestore</span> (forest restoration), and <span>RV Caf&eacute;</span> 
        (culinary arts) diversify the culture of student-led activities at RVRC. You will also get the opportunity to bring 
        like-minded friends to start your own IG and share a new colour at the college. IGs really are avenues at RVRC to
        unleash your true potential.
